  <p class="lead">Learning the ins and outs of taking an application from an idea to a realized product.  I love putting the pieces together and continually strive to master my craft and create new projects.  This website is a host for those projects, it has a dedicated blog and portfolio section to present all of my past work.  This is a bit of a portfolioception as this website in and of itself is one of my bigger projects done in Rails.  </p>
