  <h1 class="cover-heading">About Me!</h1>
  <p class="lead">Hello my name is Eric Uyemura!  I began coding in June of 2018. Ever since I made my first HTML page I've been addicted to learning more and more.  I never thought I would make so much progress in just 6 months, but I know this is just the beginning.  My passion is in full stack development, I especially love Rails and React, but am constantly trying to learn new languages, frameworks, and libraries.  I also love typing furiously into the terminal and feeling like an operator in the Matrix.</p>
  <p class="lead">One of my favorite books is, "Zen Mind Beginner's Mind", by Shunryu Suzuki, it advises to always take the mindset of a beginner, to never be above learning more.  This is easy for me as a beginner, but I plan on taking this attitude with me in all avenues.</p>
